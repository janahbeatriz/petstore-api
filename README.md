# Petstore API Tests with Newman

This repository contains automated API tests for the [Petstore API](https://petstore.swagger.io/), implemented using [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman). These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the Petstore API endpoints. The project also includes a CI/CD workflow to run the tests and deploy the results to GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Automated API Testing**: Ensures the functionality and reliability of Petstore API endpoints.
- **Newman Integration**: Executes tests written in Postman collections.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Runs tests automatically on every push to the `main` branch.
- **HTML Report Deployment**: Publishes detailed test reports to GitHub Pages.

## Running the Tests Locally

1. Run the Postman tests using Newman:
   ```bash
   newman run petstore-api.json -e petstore-api-env.json -r html,cli --reporter-html-export newman-report.html
   ```

2. View the generated HTML report:
   Open the `newman-report.html` file in your browser to view detailed test results.

## CI/CD Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`newman.yml`) that:
1. Runs Newman tests on every push to the `main` branch.
2. Generates an HTML report of the test results.
3. Deploys the report to GitHub Pages.

### Trigger the Workflow

Push changes to the `main` branch to automatically run the tests and deploy the report.

## View Test Reports

After the workflow runs successfully, the HTML report will be available via GitHub Pages at:
[https://janahbeatriz.github.io/petstore-api/](https://janahbeatriz.github.io/petstore-api/)
